Your technical task is to create a simple calendar application from scratch. To reduce the implementation time, please make use of Angular Material and the Angular CDK (this is a MUST, donâ€™t use any other libraries).

Note, the styling of the application is not the most important.

IMPORTANT: Please code this task in Angular ONLY. No React please.

The calendar app should consist of:
1. Form to add a calendar appointment
2. Ability to delete the appointment
3. Ability to move the appointment
4. Use Date() to work with time/date
5. Implement mouse Drag&Drop using Angular CDK
6. Ngfor to render calendar dates and appointments (calendar view)


IMPORTANT: Make sure you showcase your ability. Therefore its mandatory that you correctly use:
 
Dependency Injection
Lazyload for module/routes
Adding router, router-outlets, etc.
Use Angular forms with value changes, validators, etc.
Use RXJS in any extent possible
Use standalone components and/or shared
Angular Material for styles and Angular CDK is used for DnD
HINT: The more Angular features/patterns you use, the better.


Done?
 
Your project passes eslint
The project builds and can be served
Your app can create an appointment
Your app can move appointments via Drag&Drop
You have ensured all different Angular patterns such as lazyload, router, forms are in place
